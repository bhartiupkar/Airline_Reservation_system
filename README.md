Designed a robust Flight class leveraging OOP principles to encapsulate essential flight details such as flight number, departure, and destination. This class was seamlessly integrated with a MySQL database within a C++ application to efficiently manage, store, and retrieve comprehensive flight information. The application featured functionality for performing SQL queries to insert, update, and retrieve data, ensuring smooth and efficient database operations. This project showcased my proficiency in data abstraction and object manipulation within a C++ environment, demonstrating strong OOP skills.
